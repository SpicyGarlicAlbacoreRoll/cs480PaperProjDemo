# cs480PaperProjDemo

This was for my final homework assignment in Fundamentals to Computer Graphics,
but I very much intend to expand on what I've made in my free time.
(I'll post a new demo whenever I get the chance too)

The Demo can be played in most non-mobile browsers, check it!

Controls:
Movement is Arrows/WASD
E and Q to pan right and left
space to jump
r to confirm (in this case only implemented to load into the forest scene)

I intend to add a dialogue system, more characters, and potentially combat next, maybe over winter break.
